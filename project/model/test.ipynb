Your friend the Hillman agent seems to be MIA, so I\\'ll be waiting until he/she/it gets back to renew my discussions with him/her/it.

[That was me; now here\\'s you:] WP:BOLLOCKS. Well, perhaps, not, but no such (intractable) paradox is discussed here. — Arthur Rubin | (talk) .\"\" \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m very sorry that I wasn\\'t able to respond to you when you made that comment - too much going on for me to notice it at the time, I\\'m afraid. But now that it has come to my attention, I\\'m struck by its ambiguity. Do you mean that science generates no intractable paradoxes in the conventional or computational sense? (If so, I\\'d like to know how you\\'ve managed to deduce this.) Do you mean that such paradoxes may in fact exist, but that the resolutions are necessarily scientific as opposed to interpretative? (If so, I\\'d again like to know your reasoning.) Or do you simply mean that the CTMU - an unquestionably notable theory which was covered by large-circulation elements of the popular media, but whose Wikipedia article you nevertheless helped to delete - doesn\\'t have anything to do with such paradoxes? \\r\\n\\r\\nI ask, of course, because you are a \"\"relatively famous Wikipedian\"\" who participated in getting that article deleted, and as an important mathematician, must understand quite a bit indeed! More importantly, because you have taken it upon yourself to help arbit the math-science-pseudomath/science-philosophy distinction here at Wikipedia, I think we all need to make sure that you thoroughly understand it, and are not letting misconceptions contribute to possible conflicts of interest on the parts of other Wikipedians.

The article already states (with a citation) that the four parts are not official divisions (\\'\"\"should not be considered as first-order administrative divisions\"\"\\').  Then it says that, historically, other divisions (county, parish, not to mention districts that succeeded the ecclesiastical districts, then ward and constituency) have been the subnational divisions.  It is anybody’s guess whether he latter are official divisions, relatively more official divisions than the vernacular ones of the 4 countries, or co-existing divisions with the 4 countries in the multiplistic complex arrangement that is the UK.  Moreover, despite the statement that there is \"\"no common stratum of administrative unit encompassing the United Kingdom\"\", the structure of 4 (Scotland, England, NI, and Wales) is used as just such a common stratum to describe local government and to structure the article.  This is a good, pretty textbook example of inconsistency.  If any of this is not clear, please be a good administrator and/or editor and be specific about should be clarified.  Thanks.    \"',\n",

Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.

The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. \\r\\nThe article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. \\r\\nThe article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. \\r\\nOverall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.',\n",

The justices of the Oregon Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have used the \"\"greater free speech protection\"\" phrase so often in their written decisions, that it has essentially become a cliche in legal circles.  Since the U.S. Constitution explicitly permits states to grant rights, in excess of those found at the Federal level, it would seem that linking this section of the article to the article on the Oregon constitution should be sufficient.  22:31, 30 January 2009\"',\n",

(reference: court trial transcript; Queen vs. Ryan & Walker). It's no surprise that Purrum's infamous promotional book-for-profits The Hanged Man (pages 221 & 222) confirms Purrum as a compulsive and manipulative liar. The book states; The discrepencies in eyewitnesses evidence were substancial and wide-ranging. Each of the fourteen eyewitnesses testified different accounts of what they saw. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the East of Hodson and some eyewitnesses testified seeing Ryan to the West of Hodson. Some eyewitnesses testified seeing smoke coming from Ryan's rifle, although it was established by an expert on forensic ballistics Senior Sergeant Colin Letherbarrow, who testified that the cartridges used were of a smokeless variety. (Eleven eyewitnesses testified they saw Ryan armed with a rifle. All fourteen eyewitnesses testified of hearing one single shot and Hodson fell to the ground. More significantly, only FOUR eyewitnesses testified actually seeing Ryan fire a shot. The was no contest that the evidence of each eyewitness were very contradictory. Purrum's infamous book goes on to describe the discrepencies in the prosecution's case, eg. the lack of scientific forensic evidence, the vital missing pieces of evidence, the downward trajectory angle of the fatal bullet, and prison officer Paterson testifying he fired the single shot that was heard by all eyewitnesses.

I realize that there was a book on Short published under the title, \"\"Severed\"\" (it\\'s in my library, in fact).  But, if you look closely at the definition of \"\"sever\"\", Short\\'s body wasn\\'t really severed, it was cut in two.

To put or keep apart is accurate when referring to people who have severed relationships.  Divide; especially  to remove (as a part)... doesn\\'t fit what happened to Short\\'s body, because her body wasn\\'t divided into parts but actually bisected.

He feels he has the right to discredit all studies he disagrees with, and that everyone should accept his theories as absolute fact.  I could just as easily creat a website presenting an opposite view and discrediting studies that Racial Reality likes.  But I am not that dishonest.  My point was to present the other side of the story, while leaving Racial Reality\\'s also valid side there as well; in this way, the reader can draw his or her own conclusions. But the way the article is now is extremely one-sided.\\r\\n\\r\\nBlood group studies from the 1970\\'s are not incorrect. This method has fallen out of fashion merely because it is less sensitive than the newer DNA method we have access to.  This fact doesn\\'t discredit older studies that use blood groups, since the blood groups and blood proteins used are specific to certain populations.  Since the decoding of the human genome, we have access to more sensitive methods of determing admixture.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of how blood groups studies are valid is the Duffy null marker. The Duffy blood-group types have been known for many decades, as has their usefulness in identifying continent of ancestry. But it has been only within the past decade that we have known that a person\\'s Duffy blood-group type is encoded on the long arm of his/her chromosome #1, about 23.2 centimorgans out from the chromosome\\'s centromere. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, you can measure the end-result of a person\\'s genetic makeup by serological analysis (blood group tests), or you can measure the actual genetic makeup itself in the DNA. The latter is more precise since some proteins are produced (or not) only in homozygotes and so are invisible to serological analysis but visible in the DNA. If anything, serological analysis will understimate true admixture. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ghiani study specifically states that it shows significant admixture.  Anyone can see this when reading the abstract. However, what they mean by \"\"significant\"\" is \"\"statistically significant\"\", not that a large portion of Sicilians\\' DNA is African. Five percent or more is usually considered statistically significant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Calo study presents support for the east-west division in Sicily, and shows relatedness between Sicilians and Egyptians.  Egyptians were imported to Sicily during the Saracen period as farmers, so the connection between Sicilians and Egyptians is not spurious. The study\\'s use of perfectly valid blood group and mtDNA studies which show sub-Saharan admixture in Sicily were merely to show that other studies found \"\"African\"\" admixture there, regardless of whether it was sub-Saharan or North African.  There are other studies which lump the two together. The whole point was to show a relationship with the (diverse) peoples of the continent of Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Semino study from 1989 which found 4 sub-Saharan haplotypes out of a population of 91 diverse Sicilians is not \"\"problematic,\"\" as Racial Reality would have us believe, but is a perfectly valid mtDNA study using restriction enzymes, a method still widely used today, since it is cost-effective and accurate.  RFLP\\'s cut the DNA at specified locations, and \"\"indels\"\" (insertion and deletions polymorphisms) are very easy to spot in this way. There are other studies that have found less (or in one case, no) sub-Saharan material in the Sicilian gene pool.  This is normal, since all samples are different, and because of this, all tests will yield different results.  One certainly can\\'t \"\"refute\"\" or \"\"overrule\"\" the other.  The 2001 Vona study (finding no sub-Saharan genes in Sicilians) that referenced the 1989 Semino study did so for comparison purposes only.  Furthermore, it tested only 49 Siclians from the single villige of Alia.  No reliable conclusions can be reached for the Sicilian population as a whole from such a narrow sample.  Dr. Ornella Semino, a former colleage of mine, found it both amusing and a bit disturbing when I mentioned to here that certain non-professional forum posters considered her study \"\"outdated\"\" or \"\"overruled\"\" or \"\"refuted\"\"  all absolute drivel!\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, the person who wrote this...\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\"Lastly, talk of races is all hogwash in any event...\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n...should be aware that the person made the steward of all things Sicilian, the above-mentioned Racial Reality, is a proponent of the existence of races...just look at his handle.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am a retired geneticist, and I do believe I have something valuable to contribute.  Incidentally, I am of partial Sicilian ancestry, and am proud of all who contributed to that great island\\'s melting-pot population.

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n TruSilver, Mediation, et al \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can include the following statement as part of the mediation template if you wish: I\\'m not able to edit at the moment because jdchamp\\'s admin shopping on WP:AIV finally paid off\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile, obviously, I\\'m happy to accept any attempt to produce a better US Mobile Phone Companies template, I have concerns about the mediation proposal currently made on the subject.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy first concern is that mediation is supposed to be one of the tools used after discussion has failed on the relevant article\\'s discussion page. At this stage, the only person who appears steadfastly unable to posit views other than attacks on editors and the fact he disagrees with them (a discussion requires that you express your reasons why, and address the reasons given by the people who have opposing views) is jdchamp. A better position at this point would be to ask jdchamp to participate fully in the discussion on the Talk: page of the appropriate article. I have contributed my views to that discussion page multiple times in the last two weeks, and given my reasons for my beliefs. I have done also said that I believe this is the most appropriate action at this stage to jdchamp, and to TruSilver, the admin jdchamp has involved in the dispute about what is going on there. Unfortunately, he has instead repeatedly posted the same comments over and over again to my talk: page, varying from false accusations of bad conduct from me, to expressing a willingness to discuss the article (yet, for some reason, not followed by actual action on his part.)\\r\\n\\r\\nMediation only makes sense if the parties involved continue to have a dispute that\\'s based upon a genuine difference of opinion after proper discussion. While that different of opinion might exist at this point, unless jdchamp actually expresses his differing opinion fully (as in, gives valid reasons and challenges the reasons his opponents give with legitimate arguments), there has been no discussion, and therefore going on to the next stage of dispute resolution seems premature.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy second concern, and believe me I\\'m not happy in saying this, is that I have concerns about TruSilver as the mediator. Please do not take anything I say about this as assuming bad faith, I\\'m absolutely sure TruSilver thinks what he\\'s done is right: but that said, I don\\'t trust his judgment on this issue, based upon an on-going harassment campaign leveled against me by jdchamp. TruSilver has consistently misrepresented my actions while doing little to challenge jdchamp\\'s on-going campaign. In particular:\\r\\n\\r\\n TruSilver has accused me of using his talk: page to continue my apparent argument with jdchamp. This is untrue: I have only ever posted once to TruSilver\\'s talk: page, posting an apology for the fact he\\'d been involved in the mess and expressing my concern about it. After it became obvious that jdchamp was posting at the same time, and challenging my comments about my personal state of mind, I made the decision to not post there again.\\r\\n\\r\\n TruSilver has accused me of refusing to discuss jdchamp\\'s differences with me, these differences concerning the Mobile Phone Companies template. This is also manifestly untrue. I have have been a full participant in the discussion on that page\\'s Talk: page, even participating in a poll that I believe was posted prematurely, arguing why I believe what I do and suggesting compromise solutions that might suit all parties. I have removed jdchamp\\'s vandalism of my page, which in some cases involved posting claims that he was \"\"willing to discuss\"\" various issues, but were neither posted in the correct place, nor actual discussions of those issues.\\r\\n\\r\\n TruSilver has also leveled unnecessary personal attacks on me, accusing me of being dysfunctional, and of disruptiveness, edit warring, and incivility. With the possible exception of my (pretty justified) expression of frustration last night, nothing I\\'ve done of late fits the latter category, and the nearest thing I\\'ve done that comes to \"\"edit warring\"\" consists of removing spam that has been repeatedly added to my page by jdchamp. The other comments are just plain insulting and wrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve suffered a sustained campaign of harassment against me for most of the last 15 days. I asked for help, and instead the admin who put his hand up has essentially acted as an enabler for the person harassing me. Other than an ultimately unenforced threat to block jdchamp if he continued to spam WP:AIV with inappropriate demands I be blocked, nothing has been done to encourage jdchamp to tone down his behavior, and as he showed last night with three warnings, and multiple reverts on my Talk: page, his behavior remains as bad as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile I\\'m sure TruSilver has acted in what he believes is the most appropriate way given the facts immediately available to him, I don\\'t believe he h',\n",

It is yet more important since readers see our text on electronic monitors; often, they are not of the best resolution, and no one sees it as well as on paper in good light. Hyphens can look like dots or smudges in many circumstances.

       " \"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne reason given was that the posts were anonymous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.\\r\\n\\r\\nI therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. \\r\\n\\r\\nI tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was dismissed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomeone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat too was dismissed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nStop posting completely\\r\\n\\r\\nTry and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.\\r\\n\\r\\nHence the challenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)\",\n",

       " '\"I\\'m sorry you are wrong on both counts. Northumbrian is a different dialect to Geordie as you have said. The other dialects from the area are Makem and Pitmatic. Northumbrian being the accent that is common in the larger part of \\'Northumberland\\'. I being from Northumberland myself actually know what I am talking about. If you live in rural Northumberland, bearing in mind that the shire (as Northumberland is a shire county) is mostly rural, you would have a different dialect to someone from Newcastle, Prudhoe, or Gateshead, as the inhabitants of these places generally speak with a Geordie accent. Also no serious linguist would call all these *different* dialects Geordie. I have heard them grouped as Northumbrian dialects but not Geordie dialects. Calling them Northumbrian is correct for two reasons, one being that all these dialects come from the area that is known as Northumbria (That is Northumberland, Durham, Newcastle...etc..).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other point you are mistake. England (though not the whole UK) can be (rightly) called a Germanic nation. It is true blood is not the deciding factor as you say (though it is connected in some ways), however traditions, language, laws and history are! England was of course founded by...you guessed it Germanic tribes (whether they are the predominant DNA is besides the point. These tribes were the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. You can\\'t deny this as before the English kingdoms, England did not exist. Our language is obviously Germanic (though it has borrowed from other languages over the centuries, it is still West Germanic). Most of our common traditions, such as Yule (Yule itself is a Germanic Word, derived from the Norse Jul) are Germanic, the eating of a Christmas Ham, Mistletoe, Christmas trees, Yule Logs...etc…are all Germanic. Many of our laws come direct from Anglo-Saxon and Danish laws, though I agree many were modified by the Normans, who though descended from Norwegians are not culturally Germanic.\\r\\nAs for self-identity, I would say that the English identify themselves with Germanic culture, albeit in a subliminal way, for example the fact that they use Anglo-Saxon to describe themselves is an indication of this. They are identifying with tribes that were Danish and Northern German and thus Germanic so on that score yes the English are a Germanic people.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as you bring up DNA casually, then firstly I will point out that it isn\\'t proven either way whether the Anglo-Saxon DNA is more prominent or whether the British (used in this sense as pre-Anglo-Saxon) is. Different surveys have different results, and none have actually been accepted by all experts. And for the most part many of the newer surveys still show that in the North East of England the Germanic percentage is higher than the British (thus the predominant DNA is Germanic), the main problem is that it cannot be determined whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Danish \"\"Viking\"\" blood, but this does not make any difference to whether the blood is Germanic. I don\\'t care whether the Modern English have British or Anglo-Saxon blood as I am partly Norse-Gaelic and partly \\'English\\'...thus being a mix. I just do think that the Anglo-Saxon blood is prominent as do many experts, in North Eastern England.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way Germanic Blood or British Blood...the English are ethnically Germanic.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: I am not going to lie and say I am not proud of Germanic Culture as it is obvious (especially by my username), but I do consider myself British as the UK isn\\'t about one ethnicity or culture but about the union of many and I am proud of that also. And by the way there is a good case for Northumbria being one of the more Germanic parts, due in a large part to it\\'s folklore especially it\\'s creatures, that include Dvergar (Which they are actually called...they are Dwarves) and Álfar or more correctly Ælfe (as they are in Old English), who are known by the common English word Elf, but are the older and if I may say more correct type. \\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.\\r\\nFirst, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.\\r\\nWhat you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.\\r\\nWhat you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.\",\n",

       " '\":The norm for British & American dials is that the correct number of pulses is generated as the dial returns to rest, its speed being controlled by the built-in governor in order to sent the pulses at the correct rate (normally 10 pulses per second).  There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit \"\"1\"\") being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.   So the inter-digit pause is comprise of BOTH the last part of the return movement of the dial and the time taken to \"\"wind it up\"\" ready for the next digit.  In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.  31.185.230.165  \\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

I don\\'t want bad blood between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do have a POV, of course. We all do. But in an entry that is explaining the traditionalist POV (where there is \"\"the\"\" trad POV), it matches. And when it comes to external links/further reading (not \"\"sources\"\"), then traditionalist websites deserve to be represented as much as others. I mean, on a page on Hannukah, there might be a link to \"\"An Orthodox Hannukah\"\" or \"\"Reformed Readings for Hannukah,\"\" but with Dominick it seems to be only his way or no way. He can\\'t add a link for balance, or add \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" tag, or group links under headings as you did; he removes and replaces and mischaracterizes in the edit summaries.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am totally fine with any links to my site being labelled \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or what not (though I think the same thing ought to work in the other direction such that EWTN, for ex., is labelled a \"\"conservative\"\" or \"\"neo-conservative\"\" site  not that I am worked up about going through Wiki and making it so, but the point remains). \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m glad you liked at least most of the page on the Rosary! (I think if you looked at the links mentioned in my RfC, you will actually like them, too  at least most of them. Seriously, check this section of the site out, and the sub-sections inside of it, like the \"\"Customs of the Liturgical Year\"\" section. There is nothing like it out there on the Net, and I\\'m not finished yet!) But your words show the key differences between traditionalists and conservatives/neo-conservatives: you use the phrase \"\"attacks on Pope John Paul II\"\" with regard to the footnote about trads\\' opinions that changing the Mysteries of the Rosary was unwise, but we don\\'t see it as an \"\"attack\"\" but a criticism. Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, \"\"to the face\"\" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no matter whether you and Dominick and I agree or not (we don\\'t have to agree to be decent to each other, and some of my favorite people are conservative Catholics!), there is a trad \"\"movement\"\" out there, and we have as much \"\"right\"\" to be heard as anyone else. Or imagine that we\\'re not even Catholic at all and there\\'s a page on the Rosary: no one would remove a link to \"\"Anglican Rosary practices.\"\" I just feel as if the traditional viewpoint is being censored, and it frustrates me (it doubly frustrates me when links like this aren\\'t only removed, but are labelled \"\"blog\"\" or \"\"[[monograph|monographs]\"\". It\\'s beyond belief, really, that he is allowed to get away with it).\\r\\n\\r\\nI will promise you this: from here on out, if I add any links to the site (only on relevant pages, of course), I will use the word \"\"a traditional Catholic site\"\" or some such after it, or will group links so that the fact that it is a trad site is clear.

Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

       " '\"I have found further evidence related to this big hoax.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe same user who wrote the Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent Article, and created The Pugilist Club article you cited, is also meddling with the Barbaro Family page.  I found numerous inconsistencies with that SOSC (Sacred Order of Skull and Crescent) article which he attempted to explain away citing unnamed sources, or sources only he claims to have access to. He has edited my personal comments on the discussion page of that article in what appears to me to be an attempt to cover his mistakes.  In the discussion page of his SOSC article he has referenced pugilism, Amelia Earhart, the Wright Brothers, and a letter by Daniel Russell to a Bro. Chase, a letter which is also cited in his article on the alleged Skull and Crescent Order as being one of their prized artifacts.  The citing of this letter was the final straw for me.  I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but when I found that letter quite amazingly and coincidentally while researching Theta Nu Epsilon on ebay of all places, it became clear that the article on the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent was founded mainly, if not wholly, on this individual\\'s fantasies.  That letter can still be found on ebay by putting 200101453405, the item number into the ebay search. When I casually conronted the author of the Sacred Order of the Skull and Crescent wikipedia article with this, he initially presented a fantastic notion that perhaps the SOSC members were engaging in the ruse of selling their sacred artifacts to themselves in order to make them look worthless.  When I gave the ebay item number, then he quite suddenly and conveniently recalled that oh yes, he just remembered that in his unavailable source it says they reprinted copies of this letter for their members and that this must be one of those ultra rare reprints.  The buyer (obviously the author of the Skull and Crescent article, The Pugilist Club, and the bastardizer of the Barbaro Family page) left positive feedback for it.  Any dullard can tell an original hand written letter from a copy, if it were a copy negative feedback would have been left. Then upon looking into the publicly available links to items this same person purchased on the online auction site, I found many other fraternity related items as well as Amelia Earhart, Wright Brothers, and pugilism posters! Now I find the author\\'s wikipedia alias is Tiki-Two.  Well, that name is almost exactly what the ebay user who purchased this masonic letter uses! \\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know what his motives are, but it seems he (perhaps in conjunction with associates) are building a hoax on wikipedia, possibly as members of a fraternity. It is possible that he is building a collection of items that he intends to present and cite in articles as important artifacts of secret societies.  As a relative outsider to wikipedia, I don\\'t know what course to take, and really don\\'t have the time to find out.  I mainly enjoy reading wikipedia articles, not engaging in what to me is vain online argumentation.  This individual may find and delete this post, but hopefully it will get through to someone at wikipedia who knows what to do.

This article is still citing the 2009 edition of the same book.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that the new, 2012 edition says  on pg. 94:\\r\\n\"\"Until 2010, the recent African origins hypothesis was the mainstream position. But when researchers from the Max Planck Institute released a study comparing the Neanderthal genome...the genetic evidence shifted to supporting the multiregional hypothesis.[19]\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article\\'s statement of RAO being \"\"the most widely accepted model...\"\" was relying on the outdated 2009 edition of this book having said, on pg. 90 of the 2009 edition, that RAO \"\"is\"\" the \"\"mainstream\"\" position; the sentence involving what is \"\"mainstream\"\" was revised in the 2012 edition, to say that the evidence now \"\"supports\"\" the multiregional hypothesis.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article\\'s first sentence should therefore read (edits are in italics): \"\"...dubbed the \"\"Out of Africa\"\" theory, was the most widely accepted model describing the geographic origin and early migration of anatomically modern humans, until the Multiregional_origin_of_modern_humans gained favour.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\r\\n-\\r\\n-\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, who has kept the article locked for years and what is their reason for why it is still locked? Are the sources for each of these competing hypotheses so dubious and disputed?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd did the pro-RAO vandal himself lock this article, and then quit WP, or has had his account suspended, or what?\\r\\nWhy else is there no response to complaints about this article being locked for such a long-term, but that the one who locked it has long ignored this article and cannot be trusted to lock articles (if he is even still a WP member)? Per the fact-based accusations that were raised in the above topics in this Talk page, it should be unlocked in order to add the discoveries (I\\'d say \"\"recent discoveries,\"\" except that 2010 isn\\'t recent, which again exhibits that nobody holding a WP account is responsible enough to be trusted with the locking of this article, especially not an anthropologist or even anthro student, because if this article had even one expert editor, he should recognise immediately that the above edit requests are from veracious sources and are the reasons for the requests are explained explicitly enough that anyone worth their salt should comprehend what\\'s being requested).\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers posing this question about why this article is locked have been unanswered for roughly a year, so who locked this article, then ignored this badly neglected, scientifically outdated article, for so long? And ironically, the people who want it unlocked are desiring to update this article with recent facts, i.e. discoveries, that refute RAO, so obviously none of us are the pro-RAO vandal, but this article was locked for years (literally) even before that complaint of a list of edits by a pro-RAO vandal was raised on the Talk page, again raising my question: Did the pro-RAO vandal make his edits to corrupt the veracity of this article, and then skip town, so to speak? 209.97.203.60  \"',\n",

This will help improve monitoring of the WikiProject\\'s articles.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorm of the month\\r\\nHurricane Frank is the storm of the Month.\\r\\n\\r\\nTropical Depression Nine-E formed on August 21 south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It developed into a tropical storm the following morning. On August 23, Frank continued to intensify, but later faced shear and entered a period of weakening. However, on August 24, as shear decreased, it began to reorganize and strengthen again, becoming a hurricane on August 25. Two days later, Frank weakened into a tropical storm. Rapidly weakening overnight, NHC issued that it have been degraded into an remnant low. The area of low pressure associated with Frank was absorbed with another area of disturbed weather which later developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout Central America, Hurricane Frank produced torrential rain that resulted in at least 30 fatalities, most of which took place in Nicaragua and Honduras. In Guatemala alone, damage from the system was estimated to be up to $500\\xa0million. In Mexico, six deaths were reported. A total 30 homes were destroyed with 26 others damaged. Two major roads were damaged with another road blocked due to a landslides. Several rivers overflowed their banks as well.  Losses from the storms totaled millions of dollars. Water Currents form a nearby volcano were damaged as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOther tropical cyclone activity\\r\\n\\r\\nAtlantic Ocean– In the Atlantic Ocean, around three storms and one depression formed. Tropical Depression Four early on August 2. Early the next day, the depression strengthened further into a tropical storm and was named \"\"Colin\"\".  Tropical Storm Colin was downgraded to a tropical depression late morning on August 8. Tropical Depression 5 formed on August 10, with no improvement, it dissipated within 24 hours. Tropical Depression Six developed near the Cape Verde Islands on August 21, the first of the series of Cape Verde-type storms. On August 22 the system attained tropical storm status, thus earning the name \"\"Danielle\"\" The next day it attained hurricane status, becoming the second of the season and strengthened further to a Category 2 hurricane. On August 27, Hurricane Danielle strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane, becoming the first major hurricane of the season, and further strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane shortly after.Danielle later weakened to a Category 3, then Category 2 hurricane, and later became a Category 1 Hurricane due to an eyewall replacement cycle, while avoiding land areas. It became extratropical early on August 31 southeast of Newfoundland without having directly impacted land. It was fully absorbed by a larger extratropical low on September 4 over Greenland. On August 25, Tropical Depression 7 formed east of Hurricane Danielle. Later that day it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. On August 29, 2010 Earl strengthened to become the season\\'s third hurricane. Earl then quickly intensified to become the season\\'s second major hurricane on August 30. The hurricane weakened to a Category 3 hurricane after an eyewall replacement cycle before becoming a Category 4 again. Earl made landfall in the Canadian Maritime Provinces, twice in Nova Scotia and once in Prince Edward Island (PEI) at hurricane intensity.

He\\'s the guy on the floor that could play all positions and still run the offense.  LeBron James, Grant Hill, Lamar Odom, Antoine Walker are all guys in the league that are point forwards.  Shawn Marion and Dirk Nowitzki could also be considered point-forwards.  Kevin Durant and Brandon Roy could develop into point-forwards.  It could be argued Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan had some point-forward skill, both of them running their teams during crunch time, although Jordan will be remembered as the ultimate swingman, which he clearly was, than as a point-forward which he was when he began his career and later became again with the Wizards.  Magic gave us \"\"showtime\"\" though, he made the position what it is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.129.10.77   \\r\\n\\r\\nDirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion point forwards? That\\'s just incorrect. Anthony Mason was a great passing power forward, not a point forward.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 62.107.216.70   \\r\\n\\r\\nWHAT ABOUT POINT CENTER\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to see some information about the Point center position. Certain centers have the offense go through them similar to point forwards.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 206.246.140.166   \\r\\n\\r\\nDefine \"\"having the offense go through them\"\" for point centers...there are some great passing centers, who the offense moves through (Shaq, Bogut, Duncan), but I can\\'t think of any center who regularly brings the ball up and runs the perimeter game, which is the essence of a point. Also, Magic should NOT be listed as a point forward.  He is a big point guard, and played as a big point guard. and guarded other point guards.    The Showtime Lakers has Michael Cooper, James Worthy, and Byron Scott starting at shooting guard and small forward, putting Magic at point guard.  Most other point forwards (particularly Pippen and anyone who would qualify in today\\'s game) still have actual point guards on the floor with them, though the ball handling is reduced and they\\'re often combo guards(think Ron Harper, Boobie Gibson, Delonte West).  So Magic is still a PG, despite his height, and not a point forward.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.35.243.11   \\r\\n\\r\\nHidayet Türkoğlu played as point guard at 2008 playoffs.

It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it\\'s step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. \\r\\n\\r\\nI created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref\\'d the heck out every statement per BPL which says \"\"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.\"\". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I\\'ve found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for \"\"Boston Marathon Misha\"\" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam\\'s radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. \\r\\n\\r\\nBLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name \\r\\nAnyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored.

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a lot of sympathies for Mergism, but in this case, it\\'s a bit tricky. A Structurist solution might be better here. I would rather see less content and more disambiguation and sectioning on this page, with \"\"Main article: ...\"\" just under the heading of each section. What I don\\'t like about this page is that it favors the set-theoretic/algebraic usage of kernel a bit too much over the other uses, such as the integral transform or statistical usages.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the set-theoretic usage is more general than the algebraic, it is not the case that someone trying to understand the notion in group theory or ring theory for the first time really needs the set-theoretic version. Usually, \"\"preimage of the neutral element\"\" will do. From this point of view, kernel_(algebra) is OK, although still a bit too chatty, particularly in the \"\"General Case\"\" section. (The \"\"Mal\\'cev algebra\"\" section needs help because of the redlinks.) It also underplays the category theory notion too much compared to the universal algebra notion. Again, I think that page could be improved with better sectioning. \\r\\n\\r\\nNull space is very problematic. It is claimed on that page that some people use both that term and the term kernel to denote the zero set of an operator, where the latter term is used in its broadest, possibly nonlinear, sense. That coincides with the algebraic version only in the case of linear operators, i.e., linear transformations. I confess I have never seen either null space or kernel used synonymously with zero set, but have only seem the terms used in the algebraic (or in the case of kernel, set-theoretic) senses. Maybe I live in a bubble. If kernel really is used sometimes in this rather weak sense, then this page needs a brief mention of it. Again, the page Null space itself is rather unstructured. Better sectioning could probably fix it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHmm. That makes three times I mentioned better sectioning. Maybe I really am a Structurist.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\"',\n",

Now he is Prince george of Cambridge he don\\'t need a courtesy title. If Prince William predesease his father, the new born will prince george the duke of Cambridge and etc.\\r\\neg:- George V \\'s third son was styled HRH The Prince Henry, The Duke of Gloucester, Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden. his heirs(first Prince William then Prince Richard after his brothers death) hold Princely titles because of Kings male line grand children, as called Prince William of Gloucester and Prince Richard of Gloucester instead of Earl of Ulster. But Present Duke, prince Richards children don\\'t have princely titls because they are kings great grand children(Only Prince of Wales elderst sons children get princely titles among kings grand children) and his son called Earl of Ulster and sons heir and elderst son called Lord Culloden.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the child has been born, assuming we don\\'t know the given name immediately, should we move this article to Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge? This article may be linked on the Main page under In the news, so we should probably be prepared for that. I noticed there was already an Unnamed Prince of Cambridge and an Unnamed Princess of Cambridge redirecting to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge#Pregnancy (I have just edited them to redirect here instead). Online \\r\\nNo, that would not be right. The child will not be Prince of Cambridge or Princess of Cambridge, i.e. that will not be a substantive title like Prince of Wales or Duke of Cambridge. The child will be a prince of the United Kingdom known as Prince(ss) X of Cambridge. It would be best to just leave the article at Child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge until the child is named; the present title certainly won\\'t become less accurate or less precise once the childis born.   \\r\\n\\r\\nThe child will be officially entitled Prince (Name) of Cambridge or Princess (Name) of Cambridge. So probably not.  (Want to have a chat?) \\r\\nPrince(ss) NN of Cambridge would be the best answer, but seeing as the child will be given a name within the first couple days anyway, there\\'s no point moving the article only to move it again a couple days later. The Princess NN of Country came about mostly because of the Danish tradition of waiting until the baptism to name the child, so the articles were made when the children were born and then we had an article in place while we waited for the name. In other cases, ie Princess Estelle of Sweden or Princess Eleonore of Begium, the article Princess NN of Sweden/Belgium was created and then moved within a day or two to its proper location when their names were announced. But this article is already in place, so moving it, only to move it yet again a day or two later is pointless.   \\r\\nPersonally, I think Norman is a great name for a Prince, although Princess NN also has a certain ring to it.  \\r\\nI agree with Morhange. Additionally, we might not be certain as to the child\\'s precise style until one is used (styles have broken precedent before, remember!), so we really ought to avoid assuming something based on precedent which could soon turn out to be WRONG...

As mentioned in the literature (cf., e.g., [Lenstra, Lenstra, Manasse, Pollard]), Fermat probably knew the previous theorem, although its proof was given later by Euler in 1747 (see [Burton, p.219]). However, it is then unclear why Fermat did not apply this theorem to the factorization of F5. It was sufficient to divide F5 only by primes of the form 64k + 1, and for k = 10 Fermat could have convinced himself that his hypothesis on the primality of Fm did not hold. Concerning the factor 2142.27 + 1 = 274177 of F6 (see Figure 1.2), we note that there are 370 primes of the form k27 + 1 for k < 2142. \\r\\n  \"',\n",

If Yamagishi wants the remakes to feel like two totally different games, then why don't we treat them as such until we find out otherwise.  This is even MORE TRUE for First Departure.  How on earth can First Departure be a direct port of Star Ocean when it has the Star Ocean 2 battle engine?

Furthermore the german government policies, decisions and the impacto on german society have also been thouroughly  described, analysed and commentated on the main media press (Spiegel, etc) easly. \\r\\n\\r\\nmore Jews prefered emigrating to Germany than to Israel or feel much closer to Germany\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason number one for this preference is the exceptionally conditions (read money) that this german post-berlin-wall policy entitles them to. (much to the critic of the Israeli Governement)\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of Russian who came, would never have left the ex Soviet Union, if it wasnt for this special german policy and the catastrophic collapse of pensions and social security in Russia. Not to Israel, not to anywhere. So it is incorrect to say \"\"preferred\"\". They just grabbed the opportunity. They neither feel closer to Germany nor to Israel. They feel and will continue to feel close to Russia, were they have already spent 2 thirds of their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n Israel is a Mideast nation in a conflictive area \\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the young, connected to Judaism, educated Russian Jews, have indeed by enlarge emigrated to Israel, Canada or the US. This started happening in the 1970s and peaked in the 90s\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n feel much closer to... German language (Yiddish is a Germanic language) \\r\\nagain this is nonsense, as the vast majority of these people have never spoke yiddish. They spoke Russian and are connected to the russian culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n \"\" ...a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil \"\" and Chabad Lubavitch \\r\\n\\r\\n ... Chabad-Lubavitch ..opened this ...Chabad-Lubavitch ... ordained .that.. this and that \\r\\n\\r\\nChabad-Lubavitch opens and ordains all over the world. From Beijing to Antartica. And indeed more and more in the recent years. What I simply cannot understand is how come a minority (and extremly active) stream in modern Judaism can be representative of the \"\".a renaissance of Jewish life on German soil\"\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue of the \"\"renaissance\"\" with integration and participation of the \"\"russian jews\"\" in the german jewish community, their clashes and success stories is a well documented (and problematic one). Again, read the german (jewish and non jewish ) newspapers.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn their vast majority they were already above 50 when they arrived in Germany, and I would not say that their connection with judaism was/is \"\"that big\"\". Actually  because many of them are from mixed marriages, their offspring in Germany, no longer considers itself or has interest in their \"\"jewishness\"\".  The cornerstone of they identity is Russia, not Judaism. Again, read the german sources. \\r\\n\\r\\n \"',\n",

       " '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n NPOV and unbalanced \\r\\n\\r\\nI would prefer both tags, but I suppose once is enough.  First a certificate of Life birth is not a birth certificate which the lefties are trying to say as proof he was born in hawaii.  If his mom was a astronaunt and gave give on the moon, he could still have a certificate of live birth.  So the certificate of live birth is worthless as evidence.  His own family says he was born in Kenya, and if so his father was kenya and his mom was 16 and could not pass US citizenship to Obama.  If this claim is true, he cannot be a natural born citizen required by artical 2 section 1 of the us constitution.  Secondly his islamic school in Indonesia required him to be a Indonesian citizen, while it may be possible to get an exception, we don\\'t know.  He has traveled to ?Iran? during the 1980s when it was illegal for Us citizens to travel there, was his travels illegal or did he travel under a different citizenship.  There is no proof that obama is a natural born citizen yet more than enough doubt, and there have been lawsuits over these doubts but the courts are refusing to hear these cases.  We cannot say Obama was born in Hawaii, nor can we say he was Born in Kenya, his birthplace is unknown.  Obama and his team of lawyers, probably on the taxpayers dole, are trying to hide whether or not he is a natural born citizen; smells fishy, what does he have to hide?  As long as we have a constitution, we have to find that out or he is not the president.  Needless to say our brave military have joined a quo warrento lawsuit, and ask by what authority obama has to be president and CEO over them.  It remains an open issue, and so far there is no evidence leading us to his birthplace or his citizenship status, however the bulk of the evidence points in the direction of him being illegal.\\r\\n\\r\\n  also being censored are obamas ties to socialist and terrorist organizations.  He is affiliated with Ayers, who an uncover FBI agent recorded a dialog where Ayers group planned to kill 25 million americans who could not convert to socialism.  During the 1990 the socialist New Party listed him as a member.  His national security picks have ties to the chinese Government, and to the bin ladin Family.  And he seems cozy to opening up to socialist Cuba as well.  He has a harvard Law degree, his economic stimulus full of financing socialist and Keynesian polcies that will bleed the private sector dry while bankrupting our nation fiscally spending more and more money we don\\'t even have and a debt we cannot repay, some newspapers have argued that obama\\'s \"\"fix\"\" will cause a second depression.  So one might have to argue is a harvard law degree completely worthless, or if Obama plans to lead us down the road to destruction to nationalism and communism.  Not sure how the coffin workers bring paid in coffins will fair when everyone is starving to death, people will need food probably more than giving their loved ones a proper burial-if they don\\'t resort to cannibalism.

The idea isn\\'t to exclude information (such as some theories), but to provide as much information as possible (such as adding more theories). WegianWarrior explains it well: \"\"Wikipedia isn\\'t about whats valid or not, its about what can be verified. It\\'s a verfiable fact that these claims are made by a number of conspiracy theorists.\"\" And Blueboar\\'s statement (\"\"If a source discusses directly the theories that are the topic of this article, it does belong ... no matter what its viewpoint on the theory\"\") is valid and useful in this discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nUkufwakfgr, your incivility diminishes greatly the legitimacy of any argument you make. It would be more effective if you left out the abrasive language and cries of flamebaiting and focused only on how to improve the article. By providing a list of what needs to be fixed, removed and added (without being abrasive), other editors will be much more likely to work with you. For example, if you think parts need further toning-down, quote the current sentence as it appears in the article and then provided what you think would be a better way to say it.
